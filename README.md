## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Typescript](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/) - For type definitions

### What I learned

I learned many new libraries/tools/technologies while building this app, and jumped from one methodology to another. First I used context API for state management & to avoid prop drilling but it wasn't a convenient way at a large scale as more context provider has to be created. So from there moved on to the redux store, and learned to configure the store, create reducers, and slice & action creators for each particular reducer. This made debugging easy & more standardized way for state management globally.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
